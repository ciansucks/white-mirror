Dr. Alabio,

Can you please fill me in on what happened the other day? Quentin has been avoiding all of my questions. Griffith won’t talk to me about what happened. I know Paolo has been doing a lot of work to make sure all dimensional properties are stable and OK. 
I asked him what happened, poor Paolo looked horrified. He stumbled over his own words, and then ran off. All that I was able to comprehend was that there was something similar to a white mirror event; and some talk about a potential interdimensional clone.
Please get back to me as soon as possible, this is urgent.

Best Regards,

Hey Carol.
Truth be told, I think there was a minor white mirror event. 

Quentin went overboard with one of his tests. It ended with damage to equipment and Griffith was nearly “unretrievable” from whichever dimension Quentin sent him to. Paolo was able to stabilize everything and ensure the right Griffith was brought back.
I’ve been left to play catch up, and help Paolo clean up after Quentin since our lovely doctor decided to do this without my guidance.

With that said, I will ensure that everything is OK, and that Griffith is Griffith. I had Paolo do a lot of research into what would happen if we were to experience a White Mirror event. A part of this includes the risk of some sort of interdimensional clones... I don’t think we are totally in the clear yet, but we should be OK.
Quentin needs to have some sort of repercussion, he has been out of line. I will keep you in the loop on his behavior.

Regards,
