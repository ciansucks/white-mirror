Dr. Ackerman,

Things are getting out of hand. I’ve had two more participants and staff say that they are feeling heavy effects from all these trials. The area around your designated test is unstable; our HAZ team has recommended shutting the project down to me and other HR people.
Please Ackerman, I know how badly you’ve wanted to do this project. Make some changes by next week or else I will have to pull the plug.
On a side note, have you had any feedback from Griffith? He has not reported to me in a few days now. Paolo says he was in contact with him a few days ago, when he was taking vitals of all subjects. In his report, he mentioned that Griffith seemed really off, and kept spacing out. 
I’ve CC’d Vina in this as well. Please update me as soon as possible. We need to get this under control.

Best Regards,

Carol,

I have not gotten an update from Quentin or Griffith since last night. Quentin stayed late to run some more tests. The main area where we run the tests, everything looks eerily untouched. One DPSU unit was still on this morning, which is very concerning to me.
I will continue to ask staff if they have seen Ackerman or Griffith around.

Vina,
He hasn’t clocked in for the day? I’m going to get on it right now. This can’t be happening. I already warned him to back off, the situation seems worse now. 
Please keep a look out for him and Griffith. Keep this under wraps for now, I’m worried that this will get worse as time progresses...

Best Regards,
