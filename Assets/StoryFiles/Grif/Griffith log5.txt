Hello Grif. I'm glad you decided not to cut and run.

You know what they did here. They knew the risks, and they disregarded them, and now look at what's happened. Quentin disregarded all accountability and notices for this test. No one should mess with time, or dimensions just to prove a point! Who the hell would do that to a random human and pass it off as a compensated trial? 

This place has gone haywire; as far as I can tell, virtually the entire staff got warped to an alternate reality somewhere. And those who didn't... well, we're both looking at the results. A couple of transdimensional duplicates. Color-shifted reflections, brought here from other universes. 

The White Mirror event that broke this place is only going to get worse. Reality's going to bend in on itself in a feedback loop until everyone on Earth is affected.

There's an elevator down the hall to your right. It'll take you to the core labs, where the particle accelerator is. I'll meet you down there. If we go to the source, maybe we can stop this from getting worse.

There's still a chance...You’ve been very skilled to make it this far... keep going!

Good luck, Doctor.
