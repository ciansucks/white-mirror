Grif,

Are the memories starting to come back? If you’re ready to know the whole truth, keep pushing forward.

There's an elevator down the hall to your right. It'll take you to the core labs, where the particle accelerator is. I'll meet you down there. If we go to the source, maybe we can stop this from getting worse.

There's still a chance...You’ve been very skilled to make it this far... keep going!

Good luck, Doctor.
