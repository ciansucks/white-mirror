Grif,

If you're looking to run away, the door on your left will take you to one of the surface exits. Supposedly it's safe out there, but I won't make any guarantees.

If you'd rather try and fix things, instead of just running from your problems, the door on your right will bring you down to one of the subsurface labs. I'll be in the observation room. 

The choice is yours. 

If I know you - and I think I do - then I think you'll make the responsible one.
